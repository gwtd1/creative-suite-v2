# Creative Pipeline User Flows

## Summary

This workflow describes a highly efficient, scalable, and risk-mitigating creative pipeline. Creative Suite's core value proposition is to use AI throughout the creative process (Ideation), ensure compliance (AI Approvals), and automate the most time-consuming step (Remix/Localization), allowing human stakeholders to focus their time on strategic decision-making rather than repetitive asset manipulation. 

Campaign Mapping should be implemented as a structured data layer that is created early in the pipeline and then progressively enriched and validated at key stages, culminating in the final deliverable.

## Phase 1: Strategy and Foundation

### 1. Campaign/Marketing Brief

This is the strategic starting point provided by the marketing stakeholders. It's the blueprint for the entire campaign, establishing the "why" and "where." In Creative Suite, this brief likely acts as the primary input document, feeding the AI and structuring the subsequent steps.

**Key Outputs:**
- Defined Segments (target audiences)
- Chosen Marketing Channels (e.g., social, email, display)
- Clear Campaign Objectives (e.g., drive sign-ups, increase brand awareness)

**Campaign Mapping:** Defined Segments and Marketing Channels
- Create structured campaign map during Marketing Brief creation
- Auto-populate segment/channel requirements across all phases

### 2. Creative Brief

This step translates the strategic Marketing Brief into actionable creative direction. The key innovation here is the AI's role.

**Creative Suite's AI Action:** The AI likely analyzes the Marketing Brief and past campaign performance data (if available) to suggest initial creative themes, messaging angles, or visual styles that historically perform well with the defined segments and channels. This provides a data-informed jumpstart to the creative process.

- **Input:** Campaign/Marketing Brief
- **Output:** Creative Brief, Segments
- **Campaign Mapping:** Defined Segments and Marketing Channels

## Phase 2: AI-Powered Core Asset Creation

### 3. Ideation (Creative Details)

This is the core concept generation step where the AI truly shines.

**Creative Suite's AI Action:** The AI generates a wide variety of initial creative concepts—potential ad copy, headlines, taglines, and rough visual concepts—based on the combined data from the Marketing Brief (strategy), Campaign Brief (creative direction), and the refined Segment (audience). - Execute multiple ideation concepts in parallel


- **Input:** Creative Brief, brand guidelines
- **Output:** Ideas in text form
- **Examples:** Ad copy, headlines, taglines
- **Campaign Mapping:** Defined Segments and Marketing Channels

#### AI Approvals

**Legal Review:** AI scans content for potential legal issues, claims, or regulatory compliance flags (e.g., privacy rules, disclaimers).

**Branding Review:** AI analyzes the content against predefined brand guidelines for Voice + Tone, Values, and Guiding Principles to ensure brand consistency before it moves forward.

- **Input:** Ideas in text form (Ad copy, headlines, taglines), brand guidelines, legal guidelines
- **Output:** Approvals Review (binary or score) of Ideas in text form (Ad copy, headlines, taglines)
- **Campaign Mapping:** Defined Segments and Marketing Channels

#### Human Review

**Creative Suite's Action:** The platform displays all AI-generated content alongside supporting elements like Mood Boards and all preceding brief information. 

Stakeholders can efficiently deny, confirm, or comment. A key feature is the ability to use the AI to quickly generate and add new ideas based on live feedback (e.g., "Generate 5 new headlines that are more upbeat").

- **Input:** Ideas (text)
- **Output:** Ideas + Visualizations, Idea Status (Approved, Denied, Pending)
- **Campaign Mapping:** Defined Segments and Marketing Channels

### 4. Core Asset Creation

The selected, approved idea is now developed into the final asset(s). This is the traditional design and copywriting phase, likely utilizing the agents integrated within Creative Suite. Creation can read from DAM to pull in necessary assets. Generate core assets for different segments concurrently.


- **Input:** Ideas and visualization
- **Output:** Creative assets
- **Goal:** Produce a complete set of creative assets aligned with campaign needs

#### Human Review

A final check on the polished Core Creative assets before they are scaled.

**Creative Suite's Action:** Stakeholders review the core asset, confirming that they align with the approved concepts and meet all quality standards. This is done through commenting on the core asset and accepting or rejecting it within the UI.

- **Stakeholders:** Marketing and creative stakeholders
- **Input:** Creative asset
- **Output:** Creative Asset, Asset Status (Approved, Denied, Pending)
- **Campaign Mapping:** Defined Segments and Marketing Channels

## Phase 3: AI-Powered Remix with Variations and Localization

### 5. Remix with Variations and Localization

This is the essential step for campaign localization and channel optimization, fully powered by AI.

**Creative Suite's AI Action:** The AI automatically generates a matrix or table of asset variations based on defined localization needs.

**Location and Gender:** The AI adjusts creative elements (e.g., translating copy, swapping out models, or adjusting cultural references) to suit specific geographic markets and target demographics.

**Resizing:** The AI automatically refines the final creative to meet the exact technical specifications for every channel in the Marketing Brief (e.g., an Instagram Story, a banner ad, an email header).

**AI Review:** A final automated check confirms that all "remixed" assets meet basic quality and compliance standards (e.g., text is readable, all assets are correctly sized).

- **Input:** Approved Creative Asset
- **Output:** Table of Assets
- **Campaign Mapping:** AI uses the Campaign Map data defined in Phase 1 to generate the Table of Assets (variations)
  - Tags the asset based on the requirements that triggered its creation for channel
  - Tags it with its specific market/segment

### 6. Approval and Review

This appears to be a final, overarching AI-driven quality assurance check on the entire batch of assets generated during the Remix phase, ensuring all final assets are campaign-ready.

- **Input:** Table of Assets
- **Output:** Approved Table of Assets
- **Automated pass-through:** For reformatting stage

#### Human Review

**Creative and Marketing Approval:** For AI-generated core assets & variations.

## Phase 4: Activation

### 7. Campaign Mapping

Assets are mapped to specific campaigns and channels for clear campaign-ready package of deliverables.

- **Input:** Final asset library (core + variations + reformats)
- **Output:** Assets mapped to specific campaigns and channels
- **Goal:** Provide a clear, campaign-ready package of deliverables
